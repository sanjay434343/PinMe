# Parkle

## Overview
Parkle is an intelligent location assistant designed to help you effortlessly find any saved spot or itemâ€”whether it's your parked car, bike, luggage, tent, or any other important location. Leveraging advanced location algorithms, sensor fusion, and real-time navigation, Parkle eliminates the stress of losing track of your belongings or places in large, busy, or unfamiliar environments.

## Core Use Cases
- Instantly save the location of your car, bike, luggage, tent, or any item with a single tap.
- Navigate back to your saved spot using a dynamic arrow and interactive map.
- Monitor real-time distance, direction, and step count as you walk.
- Receive persistent, actionable notifications and arrival alerts.
- Re-route navigation with one click if you need to restart your search.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Arrow Navigation:** Real-time directional guidance to any saved location, adapting to your movement and orientation.
- **Satellite Map Integration:** Visualize your position and your saved spot on a high-resolution map.
- **Step & Movement Tracking:** Accurately counts steps and detects movement for enhanced navigation feedback.
- **Persistent Live Notifications:** Foreground notifications (Google Maps style) with sound, keeping you informed throughout your journey.
- **Re-route Functionality:** Instantly restart navigation if you need to search again.
- **Customizable Distance Units:** Choose between meters, kilometers, feet, or centimeters for personalized feedback.
- **Location Name Personalization:** Save and display a custom name for any location or item.

## Technology & Algorithms
- **Distance Calculation:**
  - Utilizes the Haversine formula for precise global distance measurement.
  - Employs Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev formulas for local, context-aware distance estimation.
- **Sensor Fusion:**
  - Integrates compass, accelerometer, and gyroscope data for accurate heading, movement, and step detection.
- **Proximity Detection:**
  - Implements a multi-zone system (far, near, close, here) based on distance and confidence metrics.
- **Location History & Precision:**
  - Maintains both high-accuracy and general location readings to optimize navigation reliability.
- **Cross-Platform Architecture:**
  - Built with Flutter for seamless UI and business logic, and Kotlin for advanced Android notification and foreground service management.
